title: What hardware do I use

This is a page describing what hardware I use *outside* of my job, as I have a dedicated desktop at my job which is as interesting a grain of sand in the Sahara.

This is my main workstation, named "Wonderbox".

I think you understand what that is: a gaming rig. I've built this rig in early 2016 as I wanted a real gaming rig for more than 5 years but I never had the money to afford it.

This is my current configuration :

- Intel Core i5 6600K (Overclocked at 4.5GHz)
- Azus Maximus VII Ranger motherboard (Z170 chipset)
- 16 GB of DDR4-2133 (HyperX Fury)
- Asus GTX970 Strix GPU (Overclocked as well)
- Scythe Mugen 4 CPU cooler (really efficient)
- A CoolerMaster Master Case Pro 5
- A 750 Watt power supply (platinum rating)
- A few SSDs and HDDs
- Led strips to give everyone around an epileptic seizure

Of course, I run Windows on it, but I also do a lot of coding on it using virtual machines. It is powerful enough so that I can have a fullscreen VM of Ubuntu (or any needed OS) without too much compromises.

Altough I really like this workstation (it's my baby), I'm probably gonna do some changes as I would like to use a system such as LimeTech's [UnRaid](https://lime-technology.com/what-is-unraid/) so I could run all my OSs as virtual machines and use GPU pass-through to get bare metal graphics performances in windows. I still need a little bit of funding to get bigger HDDs and a second graphics card

When I'm not at home, I carry with me a Dell XPS 13

This is a really nice ultrabook. With an i7-6560U, 16GB of RAM, a 256GB SSD and a Full HD screen, it's an excellent laptop for programming, web development and game dev. The battery life lasts more than enough for my needs and it's really lightweight.

The only downside is that it doesn't have any plug for an external monitor but it rocks a USB type-c connector which supports Thunderbolt 3, so an external dongle can fix that for me.
