Since the introduction of tablets and smartphones on the market, sales of personal computers have lowered every year. Laptops were already doing better than desktop computers because of their portability and price/features ratio.

I'm a strong fan of desktop computers, I love how easy it is to expand, upgrade, clean etc... You can do whatever you want starting from a standard x86 motherboard. From the smallest, passively cooled NUC to the most expensive gaming computer with water cooling. But outside of highly demanding tasks such as 4K video editing, 3D work, scientific calculations and the like, the desktop/workstation has lost it's interest. The general user does almost everything in a browser nowadays so he is much more inclined to use a tablet, a laptop or his smartphone, because it is easy to carry around. More than half of internet browsing is done from a smartphone, people spend more time on their apps than in front of a 24' monitor and most of the desktops they use, is the one they have at the office.

But all of this as led to what I would consider a problem : We have too many devices. If we take my case as an example, I use on a regular basis :

- a smartphone
- a laptop
- a desktop computer
- a 7' tablet
- a second laptop

They run on different operating systems, don't run on the same architecture (x86/arm), don't share the same configuration and have data spread among all of them.

Something that bothers me is all the potential of all your devices can't really be combined. How awesome would it be to be able to use the power of your GPU (located in your desktop) on your smartphone or laptop. How great would it be to simply share one operating system for all of those devices. Imagine if your smartphone became the center of a totally modular computing experience.

We already had a glimpse of that with (Ubuntu phone project), with (this HP phone) running windows 10 or more simply with the Asus PhonePad (a phone to tablet conversion).

Here is what I would like to have in the future : a single "central" device. Everything else is just an extension.

If are interested in the latest innovations, you've probably have heard of the (Razer Core), an external GPU that you can plus to any computer with a USB type-C plug. This is what I would call a first step towards a central "computing unit", a central device that can use the power of other computers and components, a central computing experience.

My dream, what I would like to see, what I would like to use, is a simple device that is the core of your computing needs. If you need more power for graphics or calculations, simply use a dock connected to external parts, external GPUs or CPUs. I would like a central device that can evolve using external parts, docks or docking stations.
