If there's one thing I hate, it's free WiFi. Not that free stuff ain't good but I always saw these "hotspot" as great treah to my security.

# The portal version

Have you ever tried to connect to a free wifi in a train station or at the airport ? If yes, you probably encountered one of these online portals that asks for your email address, your name and even your phone number sometimes. If you don't give them your personal informations, you don't have access to the internet, it's give and take. And I think that it's a lot of give for very few take. Giving all of these informations just to access the internet for a few minutes is a bit...too much.

If you connect to one of these network annd run Wireshark to take a look at what's actually going in and out of your machine, you'll notice some freaky stuff
