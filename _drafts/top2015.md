Hi guys,

So for the end of the year I decided to make a quick list of some of my favorites
articles, tutorials and blog posts I've read this past year. This is of course not in a specific order
and it isn't really regrouped by theme, it's just randomly copy and pasted but it's not
a big deal, it's not a top 500...

So if you're into web development, security, OOP, JavaScript, UI, UX, bacon and booze...
you might find something interesting in there.

FIY : I read these articles this year but some may not be from 2015.
