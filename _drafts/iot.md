Cisco estimates the IoT will consist of [50 billion devices](http://www.cisco.com/c/en/us/solutions/internet-of-things/overview.html) connected to the Internet by 2020

I mean, that's a truckload of devices, and a truckload of money, but the really important point here for me is that : It's a lot of money for such a stupid market.

I sincerely believe this whole Internet Of Things is a bad idea. We try to implement features in basic everyday objects just to add some commercial value to it (and making it unreliable at the same time).

Remember the [iKettle](http://smarter.am/ikettle/)™ ? Some people thought that this was a ground-breaking invention. I mean, you could boil water using an *app*... Yeah I can do that using a button on my kettle, no need to launch some proprietary application on my phone.

![Just Because you can, doesn't mean you should](/images/iot/1.jpg)

One of the selling point of the *iKettle™* is :

    Hanging around the kitchen waiting for the kettle to boil is a thing of the past.

Seriously ? My kettle takes 40 seconds to boil water, you can't wait 40 seconds ? Is it really faster to take your phone, launch the app and launch the *boil water* command ?

    It makes you wonder what you will do with all your spare time…

What productive task can you do in 40 seconds at 6.30 in the morning when you wake up ? Well, not much... I'll probably just add some butter on a slice of toast as most people would.

## The lack of standards

Google Brillo, Apple HomeKit, Oracle IoT, etc... Everyone is trying to push it's own standard and there's no interoperability between them. Most IoT devices come with their own app (which is often pretty bad). It means that if you own multiple devices from different manufacturers, you have multiple apps on your smartphone, you better grab that external battery, you'll need it.

## Major trust issues

Let's talk about security shall we ? I won't point out that fact that any decent programmer / hacker can doodle with some IoT library, get some sensors and wires together and come up with a *new awesome product that will make your life easier™* and then promote it and sell it. I'll point out the fact that it's much easier to do that
