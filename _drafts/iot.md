Cisco predicts that the global IoT market will be $14.4T by 2022.

I mean, that's a truckload of money, but the really important point here for me is that : It's a lot of money for such a stupid market.

I sincerely believe this whole Internet Of Things is a bad idea. We try to implement features in basic everyday objects just to add some commercial value to it.

Remember the [iKettle](http://smarter.am/ikettle/)™ ? Some people thought that this was a ground-breaking invention. I mean, you could boil water using an *app*... Yeah I can do that using a button on my Kettle, no need to launch some proprietary application on my phone.

One of the selling point of the *iKettle™* is :

    Hanging around the kitchen waiting for the kettle to boil is a thing of the past.

Seriously ? My kettle takes 40 seconds to boil water, you can't wait 40 seconds ? Is it really faster to take your phone, launch the app and launch the *boil water* command ? What productive task can you do in 40 seconds at 6.30 in the morning when you wake up ?
