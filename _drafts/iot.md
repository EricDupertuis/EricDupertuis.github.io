Cisco predicts that the global IoT market will be $14.4T by 2022.

I mean, that's a truckload of money but the really important point here for me is that : It's a lot of money for such a stupid market.

I sincerely believe this whole Internet Of Things is a bad idea. We try to implement features in basic everyday objects just to add some commercial value to it like smart lightbulbs that you can control from your smartphone. I mean, are people this lazy ? You can't even stand up and reach the switch ?
