Hi guys, I'm Eric

I'm a swiss student in web development and design.

My main interests are programming (PHP, Python, Javascript among others...), design, Linux operating systems, motorcycle, metal music and beer. I'm also an Open Source advocate and addict of [good sound quality](http://beatssuck.com/?page_id=17)
 
I've always been living in Switzerland, I love it here, freezing in the winter, melting in the summer (I hate summer) and extremely expensive coffee.

This blog is sort of my notebook. I'll keep notes about code, keep track of projects and write random ramblings in it.

You can find me on [Twitter](https://twitter.com/dupertuiseric), [Github](https://github.com/EricDupertuis) and [Instagram](https://instagram.com/ericdupertuis/)
