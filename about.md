Hi guys, I'm Eric

I'm a swiss student in web development currently working for a medium sized publishing house.
I'm also a freelance developer and general programmer at night, focusing mainly on the development of websites and web applications for small businesses and non profit organizations.

I'm using PHP as my main programming language but I also swim in a big pool of Javascript and a small pond of Python. I'm also always eager to learn so I recently started studying C, trying to get closer to the machine.

I'm a hardware nerd who loves building computers, so I'm never happy with my rig's configuration

I love motorcycles, beers and vikings swords
