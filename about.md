Hi guys, I'm Eric

I'm a swiss student in web development and design currently working for a medium sized publishing house and I'm also a freelance developer, focusing mainly on the development of websites and web applications for small businesses.

## Interests

My main interests are programming (PHP, Python and Javascript among others), design, Linux distributions, build automation etc... I breath open source.

I'm also slowly learning more about cryptography and system security.

## On my spare time

When I'm not working or deep into my text editor I like trying new technologies, working on personal projects, going out with friends riding and fixing motorcycles.

## Contacting Me

Just send me an [email](contact@edupertuis.net)
