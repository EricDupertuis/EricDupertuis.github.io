Hi guys, I'm Eric

I'm a swiss student in web development and design.

## Interests

My main interests are programming (PHP, Python, Javascript among others...), design, Linux operating systems, motorcycle, metal music and beer.

I'm also an Open Source advocate and addict of [good sound quality](http://beatssuck.com/?page_id=17)

## On my spare time

When I'm not working or deep into my text editor I like playing old video games, trying new technologies, going out with friends and watching at stupid pictures on the internet.

This blog is sort of my notebook. I'll keep notes about code, keep track of projects and write random ramblings in it.
