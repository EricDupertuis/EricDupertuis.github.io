Hi guys, I'm Eric

I'm a swiss student in web development and design currently working for a medium sized publishing house.
I'm also a freelance developer at night, focusing mainly on the development of websites and web applications for small businesses and non profit organizations.

## Interests

My main interests are programming (PHP, Python and Javascript among others), design, Linux distributions, build automation, cryptography, system security and more... I breath open source.

## On my spare time

When I'm not working or deep into my text editor at night, I like trying new technologies whether they be hardware or software related, playing games (video games or physical games), going out with friends, riding and fixing motorcycles and drinking beer.

## Contacting Me

If you want to speak to me about anything (software, hardware or beer among others), Just send me an [email](contact@edupertuis.net) or [Send me a tweet](https://twitter.com/dupertuiseric)

I'm also on [Github](https://github.com/EricDupertuis) and [LinkedIn](https://ch.linkedin.com/in/eric-dupertuis-92470193)
