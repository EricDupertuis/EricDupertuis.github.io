Ok so this friday I took my usual train at 08:07 and as always, it was really, really crowded.

I was standing in the middle of the train and in front of me there was this guy in a suit. Let's call him Jeff.

So this Jeff guy was turning his back at me and I couldn't see his face but for what I could see it looked like he was in his late 40's and he had a very _business men_ look.

Like 90% of people in the train, Jeff was using his smartphone. The problem was, he wasn't hiding his screen at all.

He was holding his smartphone right in front of him so, I could see everything he was doing. And I saw him log in his Office 365 account. I saw his e-mail address and even saw his password. So now, I have access to some business executive (as his id, hanging from his trousers, said) email account, with sensitive informations on it. And it's not like I hacked him or anything, It was just here, right in front of my nose.

Of course I won't do anything evil with it because I'm not an a-hole, but please, for anyone who reads this, when you use your smartphone and you have some sensitive informations on it, [don't fuck it up](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=J1q4Ir2J8P8). Don't show your password to everybody else, you never know who's looking at you. Someone with bad intentions might be looking over your shoulder.

(Oh and his smartphone wasn't locked with a password or a pattern, just a simple "swipe to unlock", which is stupid).

Please don't be stupid and take care about these sort of things.
