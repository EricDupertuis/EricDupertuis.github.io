Ok so yesterday I took my usual train at 08:07 and as always, it was really, really crowded.

I was standing in the middle of the train and in front of me there was this guy in a suit. Let's call him Jeff.

So this Jeff guy was turning his back at and I couldn't see his face but for what I could see it looked like he was in his late 40's and he had a very _business men_ look. But I noticed something rather strange when he took out his smartphone : First of all, he didn't have an iPhone which seemed like a good sign.

The problem was, he wasn't hiding his screen at all, he was holding his smartphone right in front of him so I couls see everything he was doing. And I saw hime log in his Office365 account. I saw his e-mail adresse and I even saw his password. So know, I have access to some business executive (as his id said) email account, with sensitive information on it. And it's not like I hacked him or anything, It was just here, right in front of my nose.

Of course I won't do anything evil with it but please, when you use your smartphone and you have some sensitive informations on it, take care. Don't show your password to everybody else, you never know who's looking at you.

(Oh and his smartphone wasn't locked with a password, just a simple "swipe to unlock")
