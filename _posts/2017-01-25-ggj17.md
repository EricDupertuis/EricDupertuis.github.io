## Global Game Jam, I'm back

Usually, when you have a great time at an event, you really want to go back there
next year. That's exactly what happened with the Global Game Jam. I went last year
and I really had a blast. Last year I went to the swiss ["Castle Jam"](https://twitter.com/GGJSuisse)
 in La Tour-de-Peilz.

This year, they had to go a bit bigger, as the number of paricipants went up quite a bit. We moved
to the castle of Yverdon-Les-Bains.
