Today I registered for my first Game Jam and It's gonna be my first real Game Jam / Hackaton and I 'm really excited about this event. Not only is it my first time but it's also the [Global Game Jam](http://globalgamejam.org/) and I'm going to the [Swiss event](https://globalgamejamsuisse.wordpress.com/)

It's kind of a bold move because I never created video games per say except for a few tests and scap projects with [Phaser.js](www.phaser.io) and some [RPG Maker](https://fr.wikipedia.org/wiki/RPG_Maker) projects (like, 9 or 10 years ago). But I'm maybe going with a few friends, I'll meet people there and I will try to create and ship something no matter what.

We have almost 48 hours after all.

I'll probably write some posts during the Jam and I'll write one bigger post at the end with a presentation of the final project.
